Deck is a platform for admins and managers to handle the access of company's data and resources. This is where the theme of the sprint comes into action. A company's data/ resources are assets to them. Any employee being able to access the data even after leaving the company may result into privacy breach on company's end. Deck solves this problem. An admin on logging in on Deck can see who has the access to which resource either viewing it by employee list or by resource/service list and can disable/enable the access of that resource by the user with a simple toggle switch. Apart from this Deck is an authentication system like that of "google sign in/sign up." Someone on a 3rd party platform can use authentication with Deck (provided that the platform has Deck authentication integrated) and get access to their account if the admin authorise it.
